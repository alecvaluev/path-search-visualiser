# Path Searching Visualiser
The tools used in this project: React.js, Redux.js

This project built to help visualize how various path searching algorithms try to find the shortest path from the start node to the target node in the graph

## Sorting Algorithms used in this project:
 - Dijkstra's algorithm
 - Astar
 - Best First Search
 - Breadth First Search
